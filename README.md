# Code Quiz

## Description

This is a one-page application. You start a quiz, answer questions, and are scored based on how long it takes you to finish the quiz. If the timer goes off before you finish, you also end the quiz. You can save your score and initials and see the scoreboard at the end.

## Experience:

Dealing with the many hidden classes was a challenge, but this project helped me further my understanding on the methods available in javascrip and jquery.
